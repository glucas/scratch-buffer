This was added back in Emacs 24.1, but I already had implemented something similar and missed it.[^whats-new]\r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with it, `emacs-lock-mode` allows you to lock a buffer in a couple ways:\r\n\r\n- Prevent the buffer from accidentally being killed.\r\n- Prevent Emacs from exiting while the buffer is locked.\r\n\r\nMy old `buffer-protect` package was written for the first case only. I occasionally would go in to `ibuffer` to clean up, and might accidentally mark and delete the `scratch` buffer or some other temporary buffer that had some useful text in it.\r\n\r\nThe built-in mode lets me drop this custom code and replace it with a little bit of configuration:\r\n\r\n```elisp\r\n(use-package emacs-lock\r\n  :config\r\n  (with-current-buffer \"*scratch*\"\r\n    (emacs-lock-mode 'kill)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis locks the scratch buffer to keep it from being killed, but won't block me from exiting Emacs. You can toggle the lock on any buffer with the command `emacs-lock-mode`. Use a prefix argument to choose the lock behavior, or customize the variable `emacs-lock-default-locking-mode`. \r\n\r\nThis lock mode is also nicely integrated with `ibuffer`. In my own `buffer-protect` code I'd had to advise some `ibuffer` functions to prevent them complaining if a protected buffer happened to be marked for deletion. With the built-in lock mode no such tweaking is needed:\r\n\r\n- Locked buffers are shown in the `*IBuffer*` list with an `L` annotation.\r\n- You can easily toggle the lock state on one or several buffers with `L`\r\n- If you happen to mark a locked buffer and try to delete it, `ibuffer` silently ignores the delete.\r\n  \r\nI don't need `emacs-lock-mode` frequently enough to bind it to a key, but it's nice to know it is there. And it is always nice to remove custom code from my configuration, particularly when the built-in equivalent is more tightly integrated with other tools like `ibuffer`. \r\n\r\n[^xenodium]: Thanks to [@xenodium](https://mastodon.social/@xenodium@indieweb.social).

I use <code>emacsclient</code> to interact with Emacs running as a server, so the <code>server-edit</code> command comes up fairly often in my workflow. The default binding is <code>C-x #</code>, which is fairly straightforward but does require switching modifiers to get that <code>#</code>. A quick fix is to just replace <code>Shift</code> with <code>Control</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-elisp\" data-lang=\"elisp\">(bind-key <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;C-x C-3&#34;</span> server-edit)\n</code></pre></div><h2 id=\"avoiding-prefix-keys-for-common-actions\">Avoiding prefix keys for common actions</h2>\n<p>There are some actions in Emacs that are so common that a binding with a prefix (such as <code>C-x o</code>) feels like overhead. In recent versions Emacs has introduced <code>repeat-mode</code> and provided a repeatable binding that simplifies this sort of thing: you can type <code>C-x o o o</code> to switch windows multiple times, without needing the <code>C-x</code> prefix every time. This is a great improvement; but in practice I&rsquo;m usually just working with two windows and don&rsquo;t need the repeat.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve adopted <code>M-o</code> for <code>other-window</code>. It&rsquo;s convenient and not bound by default. I&rsquo;ve also adopted <code>M-i</code> for the related action of switching buffers in the current window.

The default binding is `C-x #`, which is fairly straightforward but does require switching modifiers to get that `#`. A quick fix is to just replace `Shift` with `Control`:\n\n```elisp\n(bind-key \"C-x C-3\" server-edit)\n```\n\n## Avoiding prefix keys for common actions\n\nThere are some actions in Emacs that are so common that a binding with a prefix (such as `C-x o`) feels like overhead.

Checking the key binding, I determined this was caused by `s3ed` and had to do a little digging. \n\nIt turns out the `s3ed` commands bind their own behavior to `<backspace>` in the `minibuffer-local-map`. That binding is removed when the command is done... but *not* if you change your mind and use `C-g` (`keyboard-quit`) to quit the minibuffer without completing the command. In that situation the key binding remains, waiting to cause problems the next time you use the minibuffer.\n\nOne way to work around the issue is to handle the `quit` signal to ensure the key binding is removed. I've added this to the `use-package` example above:\n\n```elisp\n:config\n(defun my/s3ed-quit-handler (orig &rest args)\n  (condition-case nil\n      (apply orig args)\n    (quit (define-key minibuffer-local-map (kbd \"<backspace>\") nil))))\n(advice-add #'s3ed-find-file :around #'my/s3ed-quit-handler)\n(advice-add #'s3ed-save-file :around #'my/s3ed-quit-handler)\n```\n\nWith that everything is working well, and `s3ed` remains a great utility in my Emacs toolbox.\n",
